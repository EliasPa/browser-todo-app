# browser-todo-app

A simple TODO application utilising Vue.js and local storage.
Any text inserted in to this application is stored in the local storage of your browser.
Clicking the 'Delete All' button will delete
the inserted text from the storage as well.

Instructions:
* Just open the 'index.html' file in your favorite browser (needs to support local storage for this application to be useful)

Known issues:
* The program doesn't support checkboxes at the moment, normal checkboxes do work but mdl checkboxes have unexpected behaviour. Working on finding a work-around. (FIXED)
